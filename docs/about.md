Hey, I'm Chris... a Fullstack Developer based in Brisbane, QLD. I have a passion for all things tech, science and engineering.

I decided to finally pull my finger out, and put together a blog as a way to let off some steam and play around with some code on a much smaller and controlled environment.

I'm a big fan of static websites, and owning my own data, so I decided to build this blog with [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), and host it using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Having fun along the way!

import RareAuthor from '.vitepress/theme/components/RareAuthor.vue'
